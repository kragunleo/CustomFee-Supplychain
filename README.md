# CustomFee-Supplychain
Customs Brokerage Fee Audit Analytics
Project Overview
In the logistics industry, import operations are governed by specific regulatory fee scales. This project was developed to audit the alignment between invoiced amounts from freight forwarders and the official HAD FEDERMAR fee structures in Ivory Coast.

The goal was to build a repeatable, data-driven control framework that identifies financial variances and documentation gaps, ensuring that all third-party billing follows standardized regulatory benchmarks.

🎯 Key Objectives
Recomputation: Build a Python engine to calculate expected Customer Broker Fees (CBF) based on customs value and regulatory slices.

Compliance Validation: Verify fixed-fee rubrics (such as administrative visas) against known legal flat rates.

Anomaly Detection: Automatically flag dossiers where the variance between billed and theoretical amounts exceeds a 5% threshold.

Remote Workflow: Establish a digitized audit trail capable of processing cross-border logistical data.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
Language: Python 3.10

Data Manipulation: Pandas for cleaning messy currency strings and multi-sheet Excel workbooks.

Regex: Used for extracting numeric values from complex billing descriptions.

Visualization: Plotly for interactive risk distribution and outlier analysis.


📂 Project Structure
notebooks/: Contains the 4-phase Jupyter Notebook (Data Upload, Cleaning, Visualization, Reporting).

data/: Sample audit files (Anonymized for privacy).

reports/: Automated Excel "Action Plans" generated by the tool.

📈 Key Findings & Results
Primary Variance: Significant discrepancies were identified in CBF rubrics, where billed amounts often exceeded the calculated maximums.

Fixed-Fee Anomalies: Identified recurring deviations in standardized administrative visa costs.

Data Gaps: Highlighted critical missing justifications for certain "Intervention" fees, enabling targeted remediation.

🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/[Your-Username]/Customs-Audit-Analytics.git
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install pandas plotly googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 openpyxl
